Title:
PyMKS - Materials Knowledge Systems in Python

Submission Group Options:
General Track / Data Science / Mini Symposium: Engineering

Abstract:
The custom design of manufacturing processes that result in materials with optimized properties is an extremely high dimensional optimization problem with the potential to make significant technological and economical impact. The Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) framework is a data science approach for materials optimization. It uses techniques from physics, machine learning, regression analysis, signal processing, and spatial statistics to create process-structure-property relationships. The Materials Knowledge Materials in Python (PyMKS) framework is an object-oriented set of tools and examples, written in Python, that provide high-level access to the MKS framework for rapid creation and analysis of process-structure-property relationships.
