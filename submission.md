PyMKS - Materials Knowledge Systems in Python

Submission Group Options:
General Track / Data Science / Mini Symposium: Engineering

Abstract:
The custom design of manufacturing processes that result in materials
with optimized properties is an extremely high dimensional optimization
problem with the potential to make significant technological and
economical impacts. The Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) framework is a
data science approach which uses techniques from physics, machine
learning, regression analysis, signal processing, and spatial statistics
to find manufacturing processes that produce materials with optimization
properties. The Materials Knowledge Systems in Python (PyMKS) is an
object-oriented set of tools and examples, written in Python, that
provide high-level access to the MKS framework for rapid creation and
analysis of process-structure-property relationships.

Longer Description:

It takes roughly two decade to bring a new material from the lab into
production. This time consuming processing has historically be done
by exploring the materials processing space using expensive experiments.

The primary issue creating this slow development cycle is the need to
optimize the structure or spatial arrangement of a material at multiple
length scales.

Recently developed multiscale physics models have be used to reduce
the number of experiment by searching the multiscale structure space
using simulations. Yet the computational costs of these multiscale
simulations prohibits an extensive exploration of such a large parameter
space.

In order to accelerate the development of materials, there is a critical
need to create accurate and computationally cheap predictive models
to explore the structure space.

PyMKS provides high level API calls to some of the most promising
approaches to creating such models.
