# Abstract:

The custom design of manufacturing processes that result in products made of advanced materials
with optimized properties is an extremely high dimensional
optimization problem with the potential to make significant
technological and economic impacts. The Materials Knowledge System
([MKS]) is a data science approach that uses techniques from physics,
machine learning, regression analysis, signal processing, and spatial
statistics to provide objective decision support in designing and refining  manufacturing processes that produce materials with
optimized properties. The MKS in Python ([PyMKS]) is a set of tools
and examples, written in Python, that provides high-level access to
the MKS for rapid creation and analysis of process-structure-property
relationships.

# Longer Description:

It takes roughly two decades to bring a new material from the lab into
production. This time consuming process has historically required
expensive experiments to explore the entire parameter space associated
with the material structure description that includes salient information on spatial
arrangements and interactions at multiple different length scales.

Over the last few decades, mutltiscale physics models have been
employed to guide experiments and reduce the experimental cost. These
models search parameter spaces often using expensive and detailed
methods such as finite elements or molecular dynamics at each length
scale requiring a massive computational cost, which tends to prohibit
large parameter space explorations.

Statistical learning approaches have the potential to augment multiscale
physics models to vastly improve efficiency when exploring
process-structure-property relationships in materials. The aim of PyMKS
is to provide a high level API to statistical learning approaches and
enable materials scientists to create and manipulate high level
pipelines for multiscale models making model integration and validation
a much more straightforward process.
